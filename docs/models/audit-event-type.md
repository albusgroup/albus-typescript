# AuditEventType

The kind of event (e.g. "agent_invocation" for the request that started the invocation, "agent_step" for one turn, how it ended, and how long it took, "model_call" for a model call and the tool calls it requested, "tool_call" for an executed tool call and its output). "mcp_auth_rejected" records that the named MCP server rejected the credential the agent presented. Events recorded earlier use "llm_call", "tool_result", "run_failed" and "run_succeeded" for four of those kinds.


## Example Usage

```typescript
import { AuditEventType } from "@albus-ts/sdk/models";

let value: AuditEventType = "run_failed";

// Open enum: unrecognized values are captured as Unrecognized<string>
```
