# AlbusIdentityJWTAuth

A short-lived identity token issued by Albus for the calling organization and invocation, sent as "Authorization: Bearer". Your server must trust the organization's issuer (the "issuer" of the Organization resource) and require the server "url" as the audience; the issuer publishes its signing keys at "<issuer>/.well-known/jwks.json".
