# Type

The kind of event (e.g. "agent_invocation" for the request that started the run, "model_call" for a model call and the tool calls it requested, "tool_call" for an executed tool call and its output). Events recorded earlier use "llm_call" and "tool_result" for those same two kinds.


## Example Usage

```typescript
import { Type } from "@albus-ts/sdk/models";

let value: Type = "agent_invocation";

// Open enum: unrecognized values are captured as Unrecognized<string>
```

## Values

```typescript
"agent_invocation" | "model_call" | "tool_call" | "harness_exit" | "run_failed" | "run_succeeded" | "llm_call" | "tool_result" | Unrecognized<string>
```
